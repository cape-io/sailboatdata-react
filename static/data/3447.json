With almost 40 built, it was a huge success for the time, and a number of these boats are still sailing. Abbott was also responsible for a later version (1941) which was an entirely new design by Rhodes, but few of these were built.\r\nThe original plans (not shown here) show an alternate \"light air rig\" with masthead rig and bowsprit.\r\nThanks to Chan Moser for providing images and additional information on this yacht.\r\nS&S Design #208."}
