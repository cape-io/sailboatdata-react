Boat #2, built in 1899, is still sailing.(New boats can still be ordered).  \r\nThe present day fleet is based at Trearddur Bay, Cardington Bay, and Abersoch and on the Mersey at Wallasey (Wales).\r\n(Trearddur Bay Sailing Club and South Caernarvonshire Yacht Club) \r\nAn article on the SEABIRD HALF RATER can be found on Wikipedia."}
