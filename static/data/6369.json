Also called KESTREL 22. S&S design #1631. 'CRUISE' is a designation used here for at least 2 versions of this yacht. There were actually 2 deck layouts and 2 accomodation plans offered, resulting in four versions: CATALINA, NASSAU, NANTUCKET and MONHEGAN. The boat displayed here has a larger and longer coachroof and shorter cockpit, in addition to a few other minor differences from the DAYSAILER versions. The boat shown also has an extended stern (The original S&S design listed LOA at 22'.)  \r\nThere is also another, later, SEAFARER 23 (built at Seafarers Long Island, NY, USA plant), which is a completely different design."}
