(26 boats) \r\n(The 40 was called CONCORDIA YAWL by the builder to differenciate it from the CONCORDIA 41.)\r\nConcordia's were built with an oak keel, steam bent oak frames, African mahogany planking, varnished mahogany deck trim, a canvas covered main deck and house top, bronze plank fastenings, and galvanized keel bolts through a iron keel. \r\nThere were a few variations from this including the occasional lead keel. \r\nIt is said that nearly all of this type survived the twentieth century intact and in sailing condition."}
