About half of the 260 hulls built at the St. Catharines Ont. plant went to the U.S.  \r\nThe original interior has 2 quarterberths in a cabin just inside the companionway. The head and galley separate it from the main saloon which extends forward of the mast with the forepeak left as storage. In 1984, a second interior (The Encore) was in introduced. This featured a large double berth forward, separated from the main saloon by a head and shower. A u-shaped galley is located to port next to the companionway, with a quarterberth and nav station to starboard.  \r\nA Volvo 21-hp deisel was the standard auxiliary. Later, this was changed to a three-cylinder Volvo, or four-cylinder Westerbeke. The bowsprit was extended in 1985."}
