Certainly one of the most influential designs and successful racing boats ever. With 160 built, it was also a commercial success for Jensen Marine. \r\nLess mention is made of the man, George Griffith, who actually commissioned the design, and agreed to back the construction of the first ten boats.\r\n\r\nThis added note from Robert VanderPol II:\r\n\"There is a single example of a raised deck Cal 40 similar to the Cal 25 & 28. Jensen Marine was promised a number of orders. All but one backed out at the last minute and only one was built and delivered.\""}
