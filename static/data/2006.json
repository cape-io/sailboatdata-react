The design was commissioned by the builder specifically for the newly touted fiberglass construction methods. (William Garden, was retained to assist in the adaptation. )\r\nThe first boats were delivered with a fractional rig with the mast built of fiberglass. (As shown in drawing). Later boats had a masthead aluminum spar. \r\nA few of this design (12?) were finished by Palmer Johnson Yachts. The molds were later acquired by Pearson Yachts and modified to produce the RHODES 41."}
