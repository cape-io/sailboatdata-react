USA). \r\nSold primarily as a trainer for colleges, sailing clubs etc. (The first 30 built were sold to the US Naval Academy.)\r\nPhotographs of this boat were featured prominently in a number of American 'learn to sail' books in the mid-1960's though the GANNET wasn't a big seller compared to other O'Day models.\r\nA fixed keel version called the MAVERICK was built for the Texas Corinthian Yacht Club as a trainer."}
