In America, it was introduced at the NY Boat show of 1955. With it's high quality, all mahogany contruction, and very reasonable price, it was a huge hit. Approx. 600 were built and sold around the world. A large number went to the US. See KING'S CRUISER 28.\r\nThis, the later fiberglass version, the KINGS CRUISER 29,(introduced in 1968) and built by �bo Shipyard of Finland and has a masthead rig. Of this latter version, 246 were built, primarily for export."}
