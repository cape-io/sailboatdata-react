The difference between the two models is the interior arrangement: the 31A has a real aft cabin with a folding door between the aft cabin and salon, and two fixed ports set into the hull. The 31 has instead a wide quarterberth which is accessed aft of the galley. Also, the 31A has two straight settees in the salon, whereas the 31 has a L-shaped settee to port opposite a straight settee to starboard."}
