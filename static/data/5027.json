The LRC came with inboard 18- or 27-horsepower diesel saildrive engines instead of outboards. Other changes in the Mark II LRC included increased tankage, beefier standing rigging and safety bars at the mast. \r\nThe Mark III, introduced in 1998, continued with the Classic and LRC distinctions. The most noteworthy feature of the Mark III was the popular optional hard-top bimini. Later on, the mainsheet traveler was moved to the top of the hard-top.\r\n(Thanks to George Stafford for providing updated information.
