The SAILFISH was originally built of plywood and many were sold as kits. A fiberglass SUPER SAILFISH MKII was introduced in 1959 and the original was discontinued shortly afterward. ALCORT produced several hundred SUPER SAILFISH a year but it was soon eclipsed in popularity by the hugely successful SUNFISH, which was first produced in fiberglass at about the same time."}
