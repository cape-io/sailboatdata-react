(Sheel had collaborated with Charles Morgan on a number of the earlier Morgan's.)\r\nThe molds later came into the possession of Morgan Yachts, where they were used for a number of years with various modifications to build a number of models similar to the one shown here.   \r\nThe Morgan nomenclature is especially confusing in the 45-46 foot range. Names were reused for entirely different models.\r\nBoats very similar to this one were sold as the MORGAN 45/46 (SCHEEL) the MORGAN 461, MORGAN 462, MORGAN 463 and possibly others. \r\n(There is at least one other MORGAN 46, (usually referred to as MORGAN 454-5, designed by Nelson/Marek and also built by Morgan Yachts.)\r\nAvailable as sloop or ketch.\r\n(See MORGAN 462 for other details.)\r\nThanks to Skip Gundlach for sharing his knowledge of Morgan's of this generation."}
