Selected as the 3 man keelboat for the 1948 Olympic Games in London.\r\nThe designer, Johann Anker was killed in World War II. After the war, his sons waived the royalty for the design to English builders as a token of appreciation to that nations  support of Norway in it's darkest hour.\r\nAlthough it's Olympic class status ended in 1972, it has remained popular around the world in to the 21st century."}
