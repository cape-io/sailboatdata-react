The first version (1938) by S&S, was a huge success with nearly 40 built. Abbott was also responsible for this later version, an entirely different design, sometimes called the NEW WEEK-ENDER. The country was on on the verge of war at this time and only a few were built.\r\nRhodes design #462. (Plans available at Mystic Seaport Museum - Philip Rhodes Collection.)"}
