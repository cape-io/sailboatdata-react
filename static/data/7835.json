This version, was designated the 'Traditional Cutter' or HANS CHRISTIAN 38T. Another version, usually referred to as the HANS CHRISTIAN 38 MKII (introduced in 1978 and built at another yard), has a slightly different hull shape, rig and interior.  A few of both versions were delivered with a ketch rig. \r\nA new underbody (with separate rudder on skeg) called the 'telstar keel' was introduced in 1984. (Available on HC 38T only.) See HANS CHRISTIAN 38T See HANS CHRISTIAN 38 T for more details.\r\nAltogether, it is thought that around 210 HANS CHRISTIAN 38s were built.\r\nThanks to Steve Cleary for providing corrections."}
