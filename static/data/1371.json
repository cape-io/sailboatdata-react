After that, aluminum was used. (Disp. and ballast numbers vary significantly.)  \r\nThe SEABREEZE CITATION was introduced in 1970 that featured a longer coach roof, dinette, two door head compartment, and a slightly longer cockpit. The rudder was also changed to a trapezoidal form to fill the gap under the counter overhang.\r\nYAWL RIG:\r\nI: 40.00'\r\nJ: 13.00'\r\nP: 34.90'\r\nE: 14.00'\r\nPY: 17.00'\r\nEY: 7.25'\r\nTot.
