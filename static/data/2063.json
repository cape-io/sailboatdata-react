The OFFSHORE/EMPIRE 40 was created in an effort to reduce costs of contruction and design royalties of the RHODES RELIANT. Although from the same basic tooling, the OFFSHORE 40 has iron instead of lead ballast, and differences in other construction details. Sold as a sloop or yawl.\r\nIn the mid 1970's, Cheoy Lee Yard built another OFFSHORE 40 (variously designated as the OFFSHORE 4O MKII and then OFFSHORE 41), which was a different boat entirely and thought to be designed by Raymond Richards). See OFFSHORE 41.\r\n(Variants of both the Rhodes and Richards design were at one time offered at one time or another under the names OFFSHORE 40 and OFFSHORE 41.)\r\nAlso offered with a yawl rig.\r\nPhoto from original Cheoy Lee literature."}
