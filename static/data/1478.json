(1977)\r\nThe tooling was acquired by Saturna Yachts of Saanichton, BC.(1981?)\r\nFor the SATURNA 33 the deck and coach roof were re-designed (by W. Garden)\r\nThe standard 'Offshore' version is shown here. A Pilothouse version was also available.\r\nBoats were also sold in 'kit' form.\r\nThe molds were later acquired by Wiggers Custom Yachts where a few more were built.\r\nIt is thought that less than 50 boats were completed to this basic design.\r\nThanks to Saturna owner, Bob Coulson, for providing additional information."}
