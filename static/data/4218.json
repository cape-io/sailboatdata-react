Early boats were also built by Gibbs. \r\nThe first SHARK gained notice by winning the 'Yachting' One-of-a-kind regatta of 1963, held in Miami, FL (USA).\r\nA unique feature of the SHARK catamaran is it's ability to be folded down the middle, allowing it to be towed using a standard width trailer."}
