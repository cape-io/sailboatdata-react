Wheel steering was offered as an option.\r\nBesides the 1' in LOA w/bowprit added, the PRINCESS 24, SOVEREIGN 23, & 24 appear similar.  other than an inboard engine offered for the 24. A version with a deeper keel (3.67') was also advertised.\r\nSOVEREIGN 23,24,and 7M all share the same hull but with different decks. It is thought they all come from the same hull mold as the S2 7.0."}
