The letter \"C\" has been adopted on the used boat market, \"classic\", identifying it as the first 34 from Tartan.  The second TARTAN 34, which is also a S&S design, is commonly referred to as the TARTAN 34-2.  \r\nThere was an option (rarely selected) to substitute a pilot berth for the cabinet storage to port, over and outboard of the dinette.\r\n\r\nThe foot of the mainsail was shortened from the original design at least twice to improve balance and/or to lower it's IOR rating.\r\nHull 125 and later:   E = 12.0'\r\nHull 200 and later:   E = 10.5' (displayed here)\r\nA yawl rig was advertised as an option."}
