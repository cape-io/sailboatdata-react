It's hard to think of a case where the first effort of any designer achieved a similar popularity and success on the race course. \r\nThe prototype, (by convention, referred to as the MKI,) trounced the competition at the half ton cup of 1969 (sailed under the RORC handicap rule). After going into production, this second. slightly modified version came back the following year to win first and second in this same event though, this time, under the newly adopted IOR rule. It is thought that at least 50 of this version (MkII) were built. A Mark III version, which followed, was built in far greater numbers."}
