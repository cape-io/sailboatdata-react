A considerable portion of these were sold in Poland, but some also went to USA and Hong Kong. \r\nKeels were originally available in lead or cast iron, the majority being the cast iron version. A number were later modified with a bulb on the bottom of the keel.\r\nMany different engines were fitted, although the most common, fitted by Trapper Yachts, was the Yanmar YSE8."}
