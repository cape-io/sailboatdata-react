Starratt & Jenks must have aquired the molds from which these boats were produced, and seems to have sold them mostly as kits to be finished by others. Both aft and center cockpit versions were available.\r\nYet another center cockpit, 'split sheer' version, (based on the same hull) was offered as the JENKS 45."}
