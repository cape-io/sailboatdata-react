Also offered as the BUCCANEER 300 with a fancier interior. \r\nLater, the company built a similar model called the US 29. When Bayliner ended it's production of sailboats, the molds were passed on to Pearson Yachts where it appeared for a  time as the TRITON 30.\r\nThanks to former Bayliner employee Craig Montague for providing information on this yacht."}
