Though a development class, no fiberglass 5.5 meters had been built at this time. The International 5.5 meter governing body decided that it did not conform to the class rules. The COLUMBIA 5.5 was raced as a one design class on the west coast US for a few years. \r\nLater it was modified and received a new model designation COLUMBIA SABRE, a cruising version with a trunk cabin, bunks for four and other amenities. Between 300 and 400 SABRES were built between 1963 and 1969. A similar version was also built by Ericson Yachts as the SCORPION 32 (almost certainly from the same molds)."}
