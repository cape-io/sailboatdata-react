The initial mold was made of plaster using an existing wood, hard chined racing sloop of unknown design as a plug. The resin used was actually called Vibrin, and was not available in large quantities at the time. \r\nAfter building a few boats for friends, production was turned over to Custom-Flex, a Toledo Ohio boat builder. A new, mold was made and a few additional boats were turned out in the mid-1960's.\r\n(rb-5/2008); (ed. 11/2013)."}
