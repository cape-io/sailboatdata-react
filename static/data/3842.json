Many boats were completed by \"do it yourselfers\" from kits.\r\nFleets have been located primarily in New England and Northeastern regions of the U.S.\r\nIn 1972 the TURNABOUT CLASS formally changed it's name to the \"NATIONAL 10\" class. It also decided to refine the class by approving a new mold, adhering to the original wooden design as much as possible. This was accomplished by J.R.Duplin Marine with some major improvements, including aluminum spars. The minimum class weight of 215 lbs was increased to 255 lbs. to keep both the older Parker River turnabout, the woodies, and the new Duplin National 10's more competitive."}
