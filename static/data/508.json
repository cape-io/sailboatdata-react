An undetermined number were also built under license by Jouet in France. The Pearson Tritons were built with wood trim and coamings, while the Aeromarine Tritons are all fiberglass and a masthead rig. (Sailplan was changed a number of times for all versions.)\r\nThe Pearson Triton was also available with a yawl rig."}
