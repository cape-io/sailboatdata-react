(became part of American Boatbuilding Corp. -1958?) \r\nThese molds were sold to Metalmast Marine in CT that turned out 5 more boats. The last known hull was delivered in 1972. All in all, the GALAXY 32 was built in very small numbers.\r\nSome time later, Paceship Yachts of Canada used this same tooling to build the PACESHIP 32/TRIPP 32. (Similar to the GALAXY but with a more traditional extended coach roof, a modified keel, among other changes.)"}
