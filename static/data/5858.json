Ballast=4500 lbs.\r\nThere were actually 4 different keels:\r\nShoal: 4.83'\r\nStandard: 6.00'\r\nDeep: 7.25'\r\nIn 2001 a redesigned 'High Performance' keel: (DRAFT 6.50') became standard and the deep keel option was dropped.\r\nAdditional notes:\r\nThe standard rig was a triple spreader Offshore Spars rig with rod rigging. \r\nA 5 foot sprit was an option. (SPL = 20.0')\r\nThe standard rig was changed to a double spreader Selden rig with wire rigging but the triple spreader rig was still an option.\r\nVinylester resins were used on the first boats. In 2002, the hull construction was changed to post cure epoxy bringing the boats closer to the design weight. The section of the rudder was also changed (profile remained the same) to give better heavy air control.\r\nCarbon rigs became standard in 2004."}
