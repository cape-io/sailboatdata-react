Later, the company built a slightly modified version called the US 29. When Bayliner ended it's production of sailboats, the molds were passed on to Pearson Yachts where it appeared for a  time as the TRITON 30. None of these unauthorized and altered copies were ever approved by the designer, Doug Peterson."}
