(S&S was certainly the 'cutting edge' at the time). Alpa, selected as the builder, absorbed some of the cost of the tooling with high hopes of building and selling many more. \r\nThe boats are said to be have been built to a very high standard, (with inspections by S&S, Lloyds of London at every stage of construction.) Costs also proved to be higher than expected.   \r\nWhen the first 12 were finally delivered, the International Offshore Rule (IOR) had just been introduced, and these boats, originally designed to the RORC, could no longer be sold as the latest racing design. \r\nAlpa only sold 3 more besides the original 12 and the whole project created a huge financial strain on the company."}
