It seems to have been a collaboration between Glas Laminates (a producer of spa's, outhouses, etc.) and Joseph H. McGlasson. McGlasson, designer and builder of a 24' wood sloop called the Catalina Islander and approached Glas Laminates about producing a fiberglass version. Using one of these boats as a plug, Glas Laminates pulled a mold and the Islander 24 was born. Evidently, the plug had \"v\" planking which gave the boat the look of a wooden boat which became an early Islander trademark.\r\nThe raised deck Bahama version proved to be far more popular and this trunk cabin model was discontinued after a comparatively short run."}
