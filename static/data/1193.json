(A sister ship was winner of the Sidney-Hobart Race in 1959 & 1960).\r\nCheoy Lee shipyard built at least 20 boats of teak, many which went to the US. By the mid 1960's the same yard had developed  a fiberglass version also for export to the US and elsewhere. Rig type and dimensions vary widely. The original drawings show a fractional rig."}
