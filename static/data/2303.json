The photo above is of 'Condor', one of only 2 built.\r\nA second, more popular version (referred to as REDLINE 41 MKII), was introduced in 1969.\r\nThough similar, the REDLINE MK II came from a different set of molds. \r\nAfter sales (of the MKII) declined, the molds were reworked and sold to Lindsay Plastics/Capital Yachts in California were they were used to build the NEWPORT 41.\r\nThanks to Jimmy Kelly for providing corrected information on these models.\r\nPictured above is 'Condor', overall SORC winner in 1972."}
