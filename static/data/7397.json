(at this time, by no means, a 'yachtie' establishment). \r\nFrom plans intended for amateur (plywood) construction. A general write up appeared in a 1959 issue of 'Popular Mechanics' and shown in the 1964 hit film 'Endless Summer'.\r\nThere probably never was a 'professional' builder.\r\nIt is thought that at least 1000 boats were completed to this basic design, though very few are seen today."}
