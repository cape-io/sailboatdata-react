There was also a TELSTAR 35 and a version of the 8m which had outer hulls which pulled in close to the main hull while the boat was in the water, but few were built. Tony emigrated to the US and set up Performance Cruising in Maryland. There may have been 10 TELSTARS built in the US in late 1980 to mid-1981 (serial numbers 250 through 259 or 260). The factory burned down in mid-1981, and all molds were lost (Tony started building the GEMINI catamarans after the fire).\r\n\r\n\r\nType      Year     Hull #s   LOA   Sail Area   Weight  Comments \r\n \r\nPrototype 1970     001       26'   298          ?
