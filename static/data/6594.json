Various options, conventional or reverse transom; coachroof or flush deck with differing layouts and rigs.\r\nAs many as 10 were built of fiberglass by Teksoglass of Sweden and wood versions by a number of others. At a later date, the molds were used by another builder in Finland to build the AQUARIUS 40 with a modified keel and rudder. \r\nNot to be confused with a later S&S 40 (IOR 1 ton - S&S design #2062)."}
