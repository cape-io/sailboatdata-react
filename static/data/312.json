Renamed ETCHELLS CLASS in 1990.\r\nThe prototype 'Shililah', was built to compete in the IYRU 3 man keel boat trials of 1966. Despite winning nearly every race, another boat, (the SOLING), was ultimately selected and became the 3 man keel boat Olympic class. \r\nThe enthusiasm for the new design grew just the same and the ETCHELLS CLASS became one of the most successful international one-design classes."}
