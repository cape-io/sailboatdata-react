A smaller version was originally built of wood by Herreshoff Manufacturing. The design was aquired by Cape Cod Shipbuilding where it was built of fiberglass with some modifications at the direction of Sydney Herreshoff.\r\nBesides the version shown above, another variation has a larger cockpit and smaller 'cuddy' cabin."}
