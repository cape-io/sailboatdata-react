'maxi' racer.\r\nThis model had a new, and apparently lighter deck than the PC versions. All boats built after 1985 have elliptical keels and rudders. All versions were delivered with the same rig.\r\nThanks to Jane Schock for providing drawing and updated information.\r\nSee SANTANA 30-30PC for more details."}
