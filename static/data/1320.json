Other changes to the design (by Bob Johnson?) were made in 1980. \r\nEarlier ENDEAVOUR 32's could be purchased with a fin keel or keel-centerboard (like the IRWIN).\r\nBy 1979, both the deep fin keel and keel-centerboard versions had been dropped in favor of a shallower draft, fixed keel model. Shown here is the later version. \r\nSee ENDEAVOUR 32 CB for more details.\r\n\r\nKeel/CB version:\r\nDraft BD: 7.83'\tDraft BU: 3.5'\r\nShoal draft fixed keel: 3.16'"}
