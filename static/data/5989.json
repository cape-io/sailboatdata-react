Those who have seen both boats have all commented on the striking similarity, especially in the case of earlier boats by Ocean Yachts. The later version, built by Sumner, (also called SUMNER ISLANDS 17), has a cockpit liner with added flotation as well as number of other modifications. \r\nThanks to 'Dave from Maine' for additional information on this yacht.\r\n\r\nBoth companies were located on Long Island, NY, USA\r\n\r\nSumner Boat Co. was located at:\r\n334 South Bayview Ave.\r\nAmityville NY. 11701"}
