TAYLOR 26. The molds from Jeremy Rogers were destroyed in a fire. Another company that had purchased the rights to build the boat in the U.K., also claimed the rights in North America. In order to avoid a potentially costly dispute, the name was changed. \r\nTania Aebi sailed a TAYLOR 26 when she became the youngest woman to single handedly circumnavigate the globe. In all, about 400 of the Canadian versions were built with the last in 1990."}
