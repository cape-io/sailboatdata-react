Most of these were destroyed in a hurricane after the very first year. After World War II orders came, first from the Chicago YC, for a new version, built of molded plywood. It is thought more than 100 of these were built. In the 1960's and 70's, a fiberglass version was built by Continental Plastics Corporation, then by Midwest Marine and Easterly Yachts."}
