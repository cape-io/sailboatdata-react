It was soon replaced with another version, the CAL 39 MII (1979), an entirely new design, also by Lapworth, and one that, presumably, the rule treated more kindly.\r\nYet another CAL 39 was introduced in 1988, this time designed by Hunt and Associates, of which, relatively few were built.\r\n\r\nDeep Draft: 6.50'/1.98m (ballast +600 lbs.)\r\nTall Rig:\r\nI: 54.00'/16.46m\r\nJ: 17.00'/5.18m\r\nP: 45.60'/13.90m\r\nE: 15.00'/4.57m\r\nUpwind/working SA: 801 ft2/74.41 m2\r\nThanks to Gay Morris for images and corrected information concerning the different versions of the CAL 39."}
