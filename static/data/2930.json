So, the COLUMBIA 24, the COLUMBIA CONTENDER 24, and COLUMBIA CHALLENGER 24, all derive from McGlasson�s wooden CATALINA ISLANDER. The faux planking, that may have remained from the original hull, or created by other means, became an Islander trademark. (removed for the Columbia line.)\r\nThis hull design was 'recycled' (form original molds or 'splashed' copies) was offered from a number of other builders under many different names for many years."}
