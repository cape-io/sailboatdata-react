(It's actually more of a catamaran when you look at the stern.) The company claimed to have sold more than 1000 boats in it's first year. (1964?) and it appears to have sold well for a few years afterward. The SKYLARK II, introduced in 1971, appears to be somewhat narrower. But no mention of any sailboat model appears in any of the sales literature after 1975. The timing was obviously right since the company builds power  boats under the Starcraft brand to this day.
