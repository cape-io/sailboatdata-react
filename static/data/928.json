These boats have an upright icebox accessible from both the cabin and the cockpit. \r\n\r\nNewer boats have an aluminum mast brace enclosed inside a molded fiberglass liner. Their decks are balsa cored and drain through hoses to the cockpit scupper drains. A molded fiberglass pan forms the cabin sole and the support for the furniture. The icebox is top-loading. \r\n\r\nThere are also a few transition boats that share characteristics of both.\r\nMore detailed information can be found at the alberg30.org site listed above.\r\nThanks to the author of the aforementioned site, George Dinwiddie, for his assistance with this and other subjects.)\r\nBasic dimensions from builders brochure (circa 1967.)"}
