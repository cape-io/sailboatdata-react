The differences between this and the earlier version: \r\nThe engine room has been moved forward to midships, the aft cabin moved further aft.  \r\nThe main salon and the forward cabin have been enlarged.  \r\nThis 'new' design, proved to be a huge success with 95 built. \r\nBill Lapworth has stated that this was his favorite design and a yacht that he actually owned.\r\nThe boat went through a third iteration in the mid-'70's that included smaller cabin windows and a different interior layout. All the 46's were based on the same hull.\r\nAvailable as sloop or ketch."}
