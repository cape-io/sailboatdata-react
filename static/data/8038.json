The standard J/24 rigging is used with only a smaller jib allowed for racing. (the std. J/24 spinnaker is sometimes used for racing.)\r\nDeveloped by Chris Rosenberg with St.Thomian sailor and boat builder Morgan Avery. \r\n15 boats have been built in St.Thomas, 14 in the BVI, and  at least 20 elsewhere. (2012). Usually owned by clubs."}
