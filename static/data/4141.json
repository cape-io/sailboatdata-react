It was certainly in the thousands. Some say approximately 3,000 and others say it may be as many as 4,500. Unfortunately the builders suffered a catastrophic fire and a lot of records were lost. Latterly they were also built elsewhere in Europe so nobody really knows. There are many in the Scandinavian area with a strong following.\""}
