Many of the earlier boats were sold to resort hotels etc. \r\nThe original builder was J & S Fiberglass until 1982. The manufacturing rights where then taken over some time later by Mariglass (Seawind Catamarans??) until the mid nineties. Later boats were built by Ross Guinea of Brisbane (Brisbane Catamaran Centre). \r\nA few modifications to the original design have been made over the years to keep the cost down. The rear beam and the traveller track were integrated into one extrusion and a one-piece trampoline replaced the original two piece version. The small cruising jib however, was replaced with a larger racing jib.\r\nStill in production as of 2008.\r\n\r\nMost often raced in the following configurations:\r\n\r\nClass A\tCat or UNA rigged single handed.\r\nClass B\tSloop rigged double handed.\r\nClass C\tSupersloop with trapeze, sloop rigged  single handed."}
