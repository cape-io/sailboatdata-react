(1959). It is thought that Pearson purchased the molds from them and extended the LOA by 1'8\", though this is disputed by some. This flush deck version was superseded, in 1964, by the INVICTA II with a standard coach roof. \r\n\r\n(Thanks to Nanette Blish, and Dave Bricker, both former INVICTA owners, for supplying updated information on this model.)"}
