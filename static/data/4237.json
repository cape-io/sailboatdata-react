Shad Turner is listed as designer on the company's bruchure, is has been said that this design actually derived from the COLUMBIA 23T. The tooling had somehow been provided by Richard Valdez, co-founder of Columbia Yachts, and brother to Rob Valdez, one of the principals of Endeavour Yachts. The boats were actually built on contract by Endeavour at their east coast plant."}
