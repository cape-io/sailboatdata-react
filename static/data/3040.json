It has a very simple rig configuration and non overlapping jibs for ease of sailing and tuning. The large asymmetric spinnakers push the boat downwind at speed.\r\nParticular attention has been paid to the upwind aspects of sailing in this design and the boat has been optimized to sail well in choppy conditions experienced on the east coast of the USA. The boat has proven to have devastating downwind speed with a potent across the breeze speed as well.\r\nThe boat is trailerable and easily launched via a crane or ramp, both the keel and rudder are retractable. The interior is functional and clean with a clear varnish finish over the male moulded kevlar skin.\r\nThe first boat sent to the States for Chris Bouzaid has won numerous events on line and placed well on PHRF. The second boat for team Foundation placed third at it's first outing in Hamilton Island in August 1999. This boat has proven itself to be capable of beating much larger boats in the Auckland harbour.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nCarbon mast with aluminum boom\r\nCarbon/Kevlar foam cored construction\r\nSimple rig setup, with non overlapping jibs.\r\nLarge Asymmetric spinnakers with articulating and retracting prod, provide planing speeds in light air conditions with class rules for one design racing\r\nLarge cockpit\r\n\r\nConstruction specification\r\nHull and decks � Carbon/ Kevlar foam core\r\nKeel and rudder � Carbon fibre construction for both keel & rudder, with lead bulb\r\nSpars � Carbon fibre mast with aluminum boom."}
