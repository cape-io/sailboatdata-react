By 1958 it became the GALAXY 32 made by the American Boatbuilding Corp.  During the �60s they produced nine boats along with Beetle Boats who were reputed to have made several more. Coleman were also known to have contributed a few hulls. The American Molds were sold to Metalmast Marine who turned out 5 more boats in the early 70�s, and the last known manufactured GALAXY sat in their sheds until 1972, making theirs the final hull completed. Paceship Yachts of Canada, however, took on production of the GALAXY, renamed it the PACESHIP 32 (Ad shown in 1966).\r\n(By 1973, Paceship was calling this yacht the TRIPP 32.)\r\nDimensions shown are those listed by builder in 1966.\r\n(rig dimensions not verified)"}
