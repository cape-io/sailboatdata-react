Two hull and two interior configurations were available. The standard rig includes a fin keel with skeg hung rudder with draft as shown here. \r\nThe tall rig has an extra 3 feet of mast, 5.5' of draft and an extra 500 pounds of lead.(Sometimes referred to as TARTAN 30C.)\r\nThe interiors came in a center galley and aft galley version. Standard power was the Atomic 4 while some came with a Faryman Diesel.\r\nThanks to 'callmecrazy' for supplying additional layout details."}
