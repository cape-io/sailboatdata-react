Same hull as the MORGAN 45 (1966). It is thought that the molds were sold to Starrat & Jenks who built  them both with the original aft cockpit arrangement and later, a modified, center cockpit model. Many were sold as bare hulls or kits for owner completion. Another yacht, probably built with this same tooling was called the EXLORER 46."}
