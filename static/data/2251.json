As the WESTSAIL 39 it was introduced just at a point when Westsail Inc. was approaching bankruptcy. The molds, (and, according to some accounts, a few unfinished hulls) eventually ended up in TAIWAN where later boats, (now called FAIR WEATHER MARINER 39), were completed. All together, it is thought that around 30 boats of this design were completed.\r\nShoal draft: 4.67'/1.42m"}
