Though the original builder went out of business after World War II and it's thought that nor more than 200 were ever built.\r\nIt survived a transition to fiberglass construction, but did not thrive afterward.\r\nRaced with main and jib only. As best as can be determined, any kind of class organization had disappeared by 1970.\r\n(Even a photograph has proved to be hard to find.)\r\nPictured here is a later fiberglass version built by Stamm Boat Co.\r\nStamm Boat Co. was located in Delefield, Wisconsin, (USA) It's unlikely that any boats were built commercially after 1967."}
