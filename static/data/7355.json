It is said that before the first (34 foot) boat hit the water, a second set of molds was created  for a 'stretched' version, first called the HANS CHRISTIAN 36, and later built as the UNION 36 among other names. Though the 36 foot version is still often considered a Robert Perry design, it was never authorized by him, nor were royalties paid.\r\nThanks to HANS CHRISTIAN 34 owner Bill Lockwood (and others) for providing updated information."}
