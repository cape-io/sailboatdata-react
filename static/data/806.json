(1960?).\r\nThe tooling somehow ended up in the hands of Glas Laminates, (later Columbia Yachts) and it became one of their most successful models.\r\nA raised deck version was introduced in 1963 called the COLUMBIA 29 DEFENDER.\r\nIn 1965 there was a styling change with a new more streamlined deck and coach roof. (COLUMBIA 29 MKII).\r\nDelivered with outboard well or optional gas inboard engine."}
