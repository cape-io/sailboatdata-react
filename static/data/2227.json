(The designer, Bill Lapworth, has said that his involvement with this boat ended here.) Some tooling  later went to Yachtcraft which sold them principly as kits. These were known as the YACHTCRAFT 44, OR 41 (with a chopped stern - also sometimes called ISLANDER 41*). \r\nDeck, coach roof profile and other details vary between versions. (deck mold may have been adapted from an another Islander model)\r\n(*There are actually 2 different boats from Islander/Wayfarer called the ISLANDER 41. The other is designed by Gurney and both are rare.)\r\n(See ISLANDER 41.)"}
