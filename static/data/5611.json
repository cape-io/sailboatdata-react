It is the predecessor to the DOLPHIN 24. First boats were built of wood in Denmark. The first boat, 'Trina', was extremely successful as a racer. A few later hulls were turned out in fiberglass by an unknown builder. Some boats were dilivered as sloops. \r\n(Most of this information comes from the excellent Dolphin 24 website.
