It was selected as the mono-type class for the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles. \r\nIn the 1940's, Edson Schock published the plans for a modified version in Rudder Magazine. This became a popular boat for junior sailors in Newport Beach, CA.  \r\nW.D. Schock was asked to build the boat of fiberglass based on this latter version. (1961) Of these, 28 were built. Thanks to Jane Schock for providing updated information on this boat."}
