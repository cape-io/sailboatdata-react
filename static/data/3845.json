(probably less than 100 were built.)\r\nA unique feature, mentioned in the sales literature is the 'inboard rudder and modified skeg. Since I have never seen a COTTONTAIL, it's hard to see how this was implemented. (this photo which is from 'Sailboats of North America' by F. Blanchard, (1962) is the only PHOTO I have ever seen of a COTTONTAIL.)"}
