After changing the cabin top and port arrangement, they began building in 1962. \r\nEarly builders under contract were Lunn Laminates of Port Washington, NY and F.L. Tripp & Sons, Westport, MA.\r\n(Allied eventually had it's own large plant in the Catskills, NY.) \r\nThe SEAWIND was the first, as well as one of the last, boats built by Allied Boat Company. In 1978 it was brought back into production and actually built simultaneously with the newer SEAWIND II.\r\nAlso offered with a sloop rig.\r\nI: 35.58'\r\nJ: 13.16'\r\nP: 31.83'\r\nE: 14.25'"}
