(The first post war S&S design.) \r\nAfter this first version, the PILOT class went through a number revisions. (A second version was introduced in 1959) \r\nThis version, drawn by Aage Nielsen, an S&S employee at the time, was the most popular before the introduction, in 1962, of the slightly larger HINCKLEY PILOT 35 (S&S #1727), designed specifically for fiberglass construction. \r\nFirst built by Fisher Boat Works in Detroit, MI, (sometimes called FISHER PILOT 33) and later by Thomas Knutson in Huntington, NY.\r\nThe original plans showed a Gray Marine gas engine for auxiliary power."}
