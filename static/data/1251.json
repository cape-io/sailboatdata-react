But the price was much higher and customers continued to order the old version instead. For a while both models were being built at the same time while sales of the new version remained weak, the economy slowed and the company approached melt down.\r\nAvailable as staysail ketch, cutter, or sloop (rare). Rack & pinion (on deck) wheel steering was standard."}
