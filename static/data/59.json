That latter was intended to comply with the Midget Ocean Racing Club Rule (MORC) by virtue of its positive flotation (large blocks of foam inside the cockpit seats and in the bow), self-bailing cockpit and enclosed cabin.\r\nExcept for the reverse transom, similar to the GRAMPIAN 22. Also similar to the CLASSIC 22, VIKING 22 and GAZELLE 22. Thanks to Ken H. for providing additional information on this yacht."}
