A later version with a larger cuddy cabin was sometimes called the SKIPPER MARINER. Later models featured twin (side by side) centerboards.\r\nAlso offered was the relatively rare SKIPPERS MATE, which had an unusual looking cuddy/cabin.\r\nA number of other variants with different decks, cabins, and underwater appendages were offered into the 1990's. \r\n(Later still, from the same tooling came the EAGLE 525.)"}
