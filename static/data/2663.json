Another boat of this same design won the same even overall in 1983. ('Scarlett O'Hara' shown in photo.)\r\nThe method of construction for this semi-production versions was very advanced for this period especially considering the number that were ultimately produced.  Besides the flush deck \"racing\" version, there was also a Racer/Cruiser version with a low coachroof, smaller cockpit, and cockpit coamings."}
