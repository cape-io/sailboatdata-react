They share the same hull shape, exterior deck layout, and sailplan (displacement and ballast differ slightly).  \r\nThe first boats, built by G. deVries Lentch, Inc., have a permanently-fixed cabin table with two leaves that fold down when not in use. At the aft end of the table is a hollow stainless pole that runs from the cabin sole to the bottom of the cabin ceiling, through which, runs a housing for the centerboard control cable. \r\nThe later model, mostly built by Royal Netherlands Aircraft, has a cabin table which completely folds away when not in use, as well as a new centerboard mechanism which operated by a control cable routed inside the port cabinetry. \r\nThe original SWIFTSURE has bronze deck hardware and fittings, and mahogany trim, while the COMMODORE version is fitted with stainless steel and aluminum hardware with teak trim."}
