The hulls appear to be the same as the HOBIE 14, with other parts shared with the MONOCAT 12, including rudders, mast and mast step. The boat had wooden rudders with a different rudder casting locking system. It was also considerably narrower which, in theory, allowed easier righting after a capsize."}
