Most were constructed in Dorion, Que. But some were produced in Edenton., N.C., (270 units) and in Arlington, Wa. (167 units). About 200 were built as keel-centerboarders.\r\nAfter Tanzer went out of business in 1986, the tooling was aquired by Kisber & Co., which built Tanzer models for about a year before selling out to Canadian Yacht Builders which never built another TANZER 22. \r\nAt some point, The TANZER 22 class association acquired the design, tooling and name of the boat by selling shares to members but is unknown if any more have been built since then."}
