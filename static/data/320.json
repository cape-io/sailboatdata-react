The keel stepped mast stayed in place. This was a unique feature and somewhat controversial at the time. \r\nLater the size of the pop top was reduced, ('Convertable Top' as in drawing),extending just aft of a deck stepped mast with tabernacle.\r\nWith the O'DAY 23-2, the deck stepped mast remained, but the pop top idea was abandoned entirely. \r\nThe O'DAY 23 (all versions) was in production for more than 10 years and was one of the company's most popular models. (1500+ built).\r\nSee ODAY 23-2."}
