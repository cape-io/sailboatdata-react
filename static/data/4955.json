Meter 'box' rule which had been recently established at the time. (NACRA's version was introduced first using the standard hulls of the NACRA 5.2 and then extending them to 18'.)\r\nAnother NACRA 5.5 (non-18SM) was available with the same hulls, less beam and a sloop rig.\r\nThe NACRA 5.5 (18sm) shown here has the boom (gooseneck) attached to forward beam. \r\nThis was replaced in the mid 1980's with a newer NACRA 18sm with updated 5.5m hulls and boomless rig."}
