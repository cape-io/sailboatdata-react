At least 500 were produced under licence in the US.\r\nA number of different variations in the design were built including both swing and drop keel versions.\r\nBasic history:\r\n\r\nMark I : The first 10 had a slight chine mark up forward due to the original plug configuration. Altogether 100 Mark I's were built.\r\n\r\nMark II from 1976 featured an upgraded hull finish and a heavier centerboards for better stability.\r\n\r\nMark III built from 1980 had a new deck with increased headroom and interior alterations.\r\n\r\nMark IV is more performance oriented with a fully battened main and a drop keel.
