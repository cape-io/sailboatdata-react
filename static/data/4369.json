The molds were purchased by  Beetle Boat Co. (a division of American Boat Building Co.)\r\nThis was one of the earliest production fiberglass boats of this size. \r\nLater, the molds were aquired by Metalmast Marine. The version they built has a separate spade rudder and reverse transom. (Sometimes referred to as BLOCK ISLAND 40-2) and was built until 1978?. \r\nRe-introduced, on a limited basis, in the early 1980's with a hull similar to the original but with redesigned deck and coach roof."}
