(cast lead keel made longer and thicker and swept-back rudder was redesigned to be more vertical.)\r\nThe deck was raised .16'. to increase headroom, the former low coachroof was extended for and aft, and the cockpit divider was eliminated. \r\nThe sail plan remained the same, but the interior was completely redesigned."}
