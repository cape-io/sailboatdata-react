In 1967 Ericson produced 24 of these modeled after the COLUMBIA SABRE and called them the SCORPION 32. It was Ericson's original 32' yacht, sometimes called the ERICSON 32-I. It is nearly identical to the COLUMBIA SABRE presumably built using this same mold. Most had outboard wells though some were fitted with small inboards."}
