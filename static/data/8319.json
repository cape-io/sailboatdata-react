(originally the Balboa Dinghy). (The small, pram type dinghy is said to have originated in Norway.)\r\nSimilar to the NAPLES SABOT but with a daggerboard. Once raced as a class on the west coast US during the 1970's, it's popularity has not persisted to the extent of some other similar designs like the OPTIMIST."}
