Sailstar Boats was sued (unsuccessfully) by O'Day Corp. because of the EXPLORER's obvious similarity to O'Day's DAYSAILOR.\r\nThe real designer seems to have been Robert Baker. (As part of the design brief, Baker was asked to come up with something similar to the O'Day DAYSAILER.) \r\nAn 'economy' version of the EXPLORER, without the cuddy/cabin, was called the DEFENDER (1966). \r\nAlso offered was a keel version of this same hull called the PIONEER (rare).\r\nThanks to 'sunbird10201' for providing additional information on this boat."}
