Most popular was the MID-COCKPIT (shown here) or 'walk-over', built from 1977 to 1980 primarily for the charter trade. \r\n\r\nThe Pilot House design has an aft cockpit and a second second steering station. Most were delivered with the ketch rig. A shoal draft version draws 4.92'.\r\n\r\nThe Walk-through version provided access to the aft cabin through the galley area without coming on deck. These were normally delivered as cutters with a few rigged as ketches.\r\nThe CSY 44 was also sold under a number of other names including the CYGNET 44 and later, the ANTIQUA 44."}
