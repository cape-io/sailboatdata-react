After numerous attempts, Bruce Kirby felt he had no choice but to withdraw Laser brand building rights in North America and Europe. Through the Kirby Torch brand, sailors will be able to maintain access to hulls, parts and the one-design aspect which is the touchstone of the Kirby sailboat design.  To accelerate this outcome, the Kirby Torch builders agree that all original ISAF-plaqued Lasers that include Bruce Kirby's name are class legal in the Kirby Torch fleet.\r\nSee LASER INTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\nIn Canada:\r\nTorch Performance Sailcraft North America, Inc.\r\n540 Elizabeth Street\r\nMidland, Ontario L4R2A3\r\nCanada\r\nna@kirbytorch.com"}
