(1980-1984). R. Hillier, of Brisbane Australia, oversaw the building of this yacht which was to be sold in the US for Bristol yachts of Newport Beach CA. For the Australian market, they were called the HILLIER/PETERSON 46.  Hillier ran afoul of designer Doug Peterson who filed a law suit. Hillier died and the suit was shelved. \r\nThanks to SPINDRIFT 46 owner, Mark Warburton, kp44.org owner Jeff, and achivist Graham Court."}
