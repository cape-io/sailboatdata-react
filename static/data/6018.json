A class association formed in 1965 or 66 and the boat was renamed the Cygnus class.\r\nThe tooling was sold to Skene in Ottawa, (who also made Albacores); when Hinterhoeller became one of three boatbuilders (including Morch in Belleville and Bruckmann in Oakville) who combined forces to make up the manufacturing side of the new C and C yachts. ...the Cygnus was available with either a fixed cast iron keel and 2 ft 9 in draft, or with a fully retracting steel centerboard, when it weighed only 600 lbs.\"\r\nDisplacement for keel version: 950 lbs."}
