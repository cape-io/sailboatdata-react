The new material proved itself after many years of hard use. \r\nA number of variants of the TECH DINGHY have built over the years.\r\nThe original design, used primarily on inland waters, (such as the Charles River in Boston MA, USA) was later modified for use in the mid-west, were they were sailed in rougher conditions.\r\nAnother version was sold as  the INTERCOLLEGIATE by Paceship of Canada."}
