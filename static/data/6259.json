John Baker who first built them of GRP initially renamed the boat GLASS BUBBLE. The name OTTER was finally adopted; coming from the river of the same name, close by, in East Devon.\r\nThe original design consisted of a single skin glass fibre hull and a Gunter rig (without spinnaker). Later models were rigged as Bermudian sloops (with optional spinnaker), and a double skinned hull with integrated buoyancy tanks. Hull weight and sail area vary depending on the version.\r\nSpinnaker: 70 sq. ft."}
