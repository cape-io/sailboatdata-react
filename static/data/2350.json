During this period, (between hull numbers 120 and 249) resin mixtures were changed to include an 'experimental' (fire-retardant?) additive.\r\nThis was thought to have cause the blistering that later appeared on many hulls, resulting in a class action law suit. \r\nUniflite went out of business in 1984.\r\nRich Worstell, a Valiant owner and dealer, bought the molds. After building some boats in Washington, he moved the operation to Texas. (The first boat built in Texas was hull number 267). \r\nProduction of the VALIANT 40 continued, on a limited semi-custom scale, until 1992 when an updated version called the VALIANT 42 was introduced.\r\nDespite the blistering problem on some of the early boats, the VALIANT 40 is one of the most highly thought of designs of this type and extremely successful, with more than 200 built.\r\nRig Notes:\r\nOn later boats the length of the boom was shortened to E=13.6'/4.15m."}
