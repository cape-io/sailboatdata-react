With the MK III, an additional 1,000 pounds of internal ballast was added. (Rig dimension as well as other details are not always consistent within a particular version.)\r\n\r\nAvailable engines for the YANKEE 30-1:\r\nUniversal Atomic-4 (gas) \r\nAlbin 2-cyl Diesel \r\nBukh 2-cyl Diesel \r\n\r\nThe S&S 30, built by Swarbrick Brothers of Australia is based on the same design (S&S No. 1999-C1)."}
