William McVay, who began building most boats somewhat later when he formed his own company, until it closed during the mid 1970's.  Paceship Yachts also built the boat for a few years, beginning in the early 1960's.\r\nThe FALCON was raced as one design class for a number of years in New England in the mid 1960's.\r\nThanks to Falcon owner Joseph Haley for providing corrections and photo."}
