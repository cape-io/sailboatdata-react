One of the most successful small fiberglass cruisers/racers ever.\r\n(Derived from TROTTER which was, in turn, a version of the RANDMEER daysailer with a cabin.)  \r\nBuilt at the designers yard as well as number of others around the world. \r\nIn the UK it evolved as the PANDORA, PANDORA INTERNATIONAL, PANDORA 700 and a number of others that share origins with this basic design."}
