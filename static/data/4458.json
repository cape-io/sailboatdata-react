The version built by Aquafibre (UK) only differed in having a slightly raised doghouse, while the Australian version (built by Swarbrick Brothers) has an uninterrupted cabin trunk. A later Mark II version has an updated keel and rudder-skeg configuration. The Aquafibre hulls were often finished by other yards.
