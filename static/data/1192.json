Hulls were molded by Halmatic, at the time, sister company under the same corporate umbrella.  A number of changes were made to the design during it's nearly 20 year production run. Beginning around 1968, a number of boats were built under license by Rudder Yachts of Australia. Some of the later boats were sold directly from Halmatic."}
