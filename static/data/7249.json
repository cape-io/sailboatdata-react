(S&S #1956)\r\nIt was first introduced at the NY Boat Show in 1969. Named Queen of the show it was one of the largest sailboats ever displayed there. \r\nIt is thought that less than 5 were built at the Seafarer plant on Long Island (USA). \r\nToday a large mosaic of the boat exists at an office complex located at the site where the Seafarer plant once stood.\r\nSee HUGHES 48."}
