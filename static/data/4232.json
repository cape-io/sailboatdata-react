This from the SWEET SIXTEEN web site: \r\n\"A Demon hull was split medially from bow to stern. One of the half hulls was then placed on a jig. The center midline of the hull was re-faired  to form a new keel line. The beam was increased to six feet. The flare of the hull was extended to form the new bow, resulting in an overall length of sixteen feet, or nine inches longer than the Demon. The freeboard and sheer were also raised and a new deck was designed....\"\r\nCharles Teeter was in-house designer and tool maker for Advance Sailboats Co.\r\nThanks to 'MacGyver' for additional information relating to the SWEET SIXTEEN."}
