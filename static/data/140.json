McCune (later the builder of the YORKTOWN sailboats)  as a one-design class boat. \r\nSome 126 boats were built before the operation was sold to Wesco Marine in 1964. \r\nAnother model called the AURORA 21 had the same hull but with a larger cabin.\r\nChanges to the original design made by Wesco included making the cockpit self-bailing and installing a sliding hatch on the cabin. \r\nBetween 1969 and 1970, the boats were built by Coronado Yachts.  Later, production was resumed by Catalina Yachts  where it became the CAPRI VICTORY."}
