Launched in the spring of 1989, the 34/36 was available in three versions (+, XL and R).The \"+\" version is the club racer-cruiser. The \"R\" is the full-blown racing version with a deeper keel. Not long after came the XL version, meant to combine the \"R\" performance with a more cruising oriented interior."}
