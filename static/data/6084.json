Ballast is lowered into the keel using small bags of lead shot. It's unknown how similar to the orginal version the later O'Day model is. Thanks to the folks at CVRDA.com for providing information on the WILDFIRE as well as some other English boats of this era. (Another boat that has a similar feature is the Milne designed VULCAN.)"}
