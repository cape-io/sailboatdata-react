Originally designed in 1961 for the Annapolis Sailing School. A version with extended coach roof was called the RAINBOW WEEKENDER. Another version without any cuddy or cabin was built for the U. S. Naval Academy and called the KNOCKABOUT. Including all variants, it is thought that around 500 hulls were built.\r\n(The first few boats were found to  be somewhat tender and ballast was increased to 1120 lbs.)\r\n(A small cruiser, the ANNAPOLIS 25 uses the RAINBOW hull with an entirely different different deck and coach  roof. A small but unknown number of these were built.)"}
