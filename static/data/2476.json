(AKA NAVAL ACADEMY YAWL/NA 44) Originally of wood planked construction (1939). Replaced with a fiberglass version (by Uniflite) in 1963 with a slightly different hull/rig design and different interior layout. (4 went to the US Coast Guard)\r\nA few of the FG version were sold to individuals as sloops/cutters. (See ANNAPOLIS 44).  Naval Academy boats were passed on to the US Coast Guard Academy for a few years before being sold off to individuals. \r\n(Replaced in 1985 with the NAVY 44/DEFIANCE CLASS by McGurdy & Rhodes and again, in 2000, with a Dave Pedrick designed 44 footer.)\r\nThe layout shown here is for the original wood version.\r\nThanks to Mainbrace 76, and several others for providing additional background information.\r\nFiberglass (1963) version shown above."}
