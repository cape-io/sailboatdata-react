(Though less than ten still exist at last report.)\r\nCreated in association with the Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club though the earliest owners were not all members.\r\nThe original 6 boats delivered in 1898.\r\nAbout 10 more have been built since with the last in 1951.  \r\nBermudian sloop rig replaced the original gaff head sloop rig in 1974. (Spinnaker permitted)\r\nDimensions from various sources and are not consistent."}
