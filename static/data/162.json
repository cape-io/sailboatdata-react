This was the ELECTRA, which had a masthead rig, a small, self-bailing cockpit, and a cabin with galley space, head and bunks. About 350 ELECTRAS were built over the next six years.\r\n\r\nPearson dealers surmised that prospective Electra buyers might prefer the boat with a larger cockpit and smaller cabin. They passed the information along to Pearson, who subsequently asked Alberg to design a day sailor, suitable for one-design racing, based on the ELECTRA hull.\r\n\r\nOther changes made included moving the mast six inches s forward, increasing the area of the mainsail, and reducing the height of the fore triangle. \r\n\r\nThe ELECTRA DAY SAILOR, as it was first called, was an instant success: 219 were sold in the first year (1962). At this time, the first class racing was organized (Fleet #l, out of Larchmont, New York).\r\n\r\nThe next year saw 213 more boats built and nine more fleets formed - in Houston, Texas; Hingham, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Huntington and Port Washington, New York, Miami, Florida; Gibson Island, Maryland; and Falmouth, Maine.\r\nThe last known builder (2003) was Ensign Spars Inc. of Dunedin, FL (USA)."}
