As it's popularity spread it aquired a number of the different names including the BAR HARBOR 17. A few of the original boats have been restored and can be seen sailing to this day.\r\nThe actual plans for this yacht, as well as many others credited to Croninshield, were completed by R. N. Burbank, an employee of the firm at the time."}
