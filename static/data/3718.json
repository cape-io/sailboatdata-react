This was followed by the more popular Mark II in 1961, which had a self-draining cockpit, more ballast, and altered steering gear. At least 300 were built when the Mark III was introduced, also called the GALLANT. \r\nThe late Tristan Jones sailed a DUBUTANTE on many of the voyages that he wrote and lectured about so eloquently."}
