A bridgedeck was added, with companionway offset to starboard. Most of the changes to the interior were also consistent with the theme of an offshore cruiser with additional wood trim. \r\nAmong other changes:\r\nFuel and water tank capacity was further increased.\r\nHeavier gauge standing rigging. Wheel steering is standard equipment."}
