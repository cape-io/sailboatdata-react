This is partly due to the fact that they could be purchased with 'product coupons'. For example, a large number of Kool cigarette coupons could be redeemed for a SNARK with the Kool logo on the sail. It was also possible to purchase a SNARK with the KOOL logo (without smoking a single cigarette) for $99.\r\nThe Kool ad campaign reportedly received 18000 SEA SNARK orders in 1971 alone!\r\nMost later SNARK's are made of styrofoam with an outer layer of ABS for improved durability.\r\n(Although the boats that were part of ad campaigns were usually built of styrofoam without the ABS shell.)"}
