Twin trapezes were adopted in 1984 to increase the sail carrying power and ease the handling of the large asymmetric spinnakers.\r\nIn 1996, the international version merged with the 'Aussie' version(orginally with slightly diferent rules). Today, with hiking racks, a giant flat head main, and it's 'skiff' like hull, an up-to-date racing model bears little resemblance to the boats of even 20 years ago."}
