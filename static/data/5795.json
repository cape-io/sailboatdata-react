(UK) It was somewhat eclipsed after WWI by a new but similar design which became the ESSEX ONE-DESIGN (1919, also by Morgan-Giles).\r\nIn 1950, designer, Norman Dallimore was retained to create a standardized set of drawings for the THAMES ESTUARY ONE-DESIGN, with a new sailplan and updated specifications. \r\nA new FG version was developed in 1966 when the TEOD merged with the ESSEX ONE-DESIGN.
