Besides North America, Sharks sail the lakes of Austria, Switzerland, Germany and the waters of the Swedish archipelago. \r\nThere have been a number of cosmetic changes to the design but, by in large, one-design standards have been maintained.\r\n'Sharkscan' has been the class newsletter. The association is active at the international, national and regional levels."}
