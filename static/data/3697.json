The Fiberglass version (built by Bluewater Boat Co. beginning in 1971) was extremely popular with more than 140 built. Many of these were purchased from the builder as bare hulls. Gaff or marconi cutter or ketch. A number of other production hulls were loosely based on this particular design including the ALAGUELA 38."}
