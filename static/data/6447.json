Sailed in the Melborne Olympic Games of 1956. (The gold medal in this event was won by noted Australian sailor, Rolly Tasker).  Still raced in a number of fleets around the world (in some cases as variants of the original). In the UK it is the BRITISH SHARPIE or NORFOLK SHARPIE. In Australia called the HEAVYWEIGHT SHARPIE, and beginning in 1960, a modernized version called the AUSTRALIAN LIGHTWEIGHT SHARPIE."}
