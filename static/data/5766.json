(Originally called/spelled BEELION.)\r\nPlans were available for the home builder but most were built of Fiberglass. It's popularity was soon eclipsed with the introduction of the TORNADO (another B class cat) a few years later.\r\nAll up weight is from original plans.\r\nA series of articles appears in 'Popular Boating', July, 1965, from both a builder and the designers covering the design process and building instructions for amateurs."}
