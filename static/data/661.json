Herreshoff for his personal use. (Originally gaff rigged as it is now displayed at Mystic Seaport, though he had switched to a marconi sloop in his later years - ) Various copies and near copies have been built from wood or Fiberglass. A number of wood replicas were built by Sanford Boat Co. from 1975-83.\r\nAs of 2006, Rumery's Boat Yard at Biddeford, Maine built a Fiberglass version that is very close to the original. Another glass version (slightly different lines) was built by Carroll Marine and some others."}
