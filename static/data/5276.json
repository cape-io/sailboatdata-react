The event, loosely called the Little Americas Cup, continues to this day, although  only intermittantly in recent years. Among development classes, it is recognized as one with the fewest restrictions. Boats that are built to the C Class rule are among the most advanced and fastest sailboats in the world for closed course racing. \r\nRestrictions are as follows:\r\nA crew of 2.\r\nMaximum LOA is 25�.\r\nMaximum Beam is 14�.\r\nMaximum Sail Area is 300 sq feet. (For the past 20+ years, the sails have been multi element solid wings with varying methods of control)\r\nThere is no restriction on weight or design of foils.\r\nThe photo is of the US boat 'Cogito'.
