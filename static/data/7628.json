Variations concerned rig, keel, rudder, windows and interior construction. (No indication that hull was changed. There was even a different type with name \"Girelle\" with the same hull.)\r\nRig has changed from fractional to masthead sloop at the latest 1966. The photo shown here is of the early version and the drawing shows the later masthead version.\r\nProbably with this change of rig draft and ballast of fin keel version has changed too: from 0.75 to 1.0 m and from 200 to 300 kg respectively. \r\nThe fin keel version was called \"JOG\" (Junior Offshore Group) (the latest since 1965; with a different rig and sail area. \r\n\r\nIn 1969, CNSO put the \"Sport\" version on the market: taller mast, more sail area, draft and ballast: ca. +0.6m, ca. +3m�, +0.13m and +30kg respectively.\r\n\r\nGeneral summary of different versions is as follows:\r\n- Twin keel (\"standard-luxe\") early version\r\n- Twin keel (\"standard-luxe\") later version\r\n- Fin keel (\"JOG\") early version\r\n- Fin keel (\"JOG\") later version\r\n- Fin keel version \"Sport\"\r\nFrench web sites say that production ended 1972. This is in line with my investigations in the archive of the leading German yachting magazine \"Yacht\". Advertising for SD stopped in 1971.\r\nFrench sites say also that 300 SUPER DORADES's were built. I've 2 indications that it was rather more than 600, first my own memory of numbers beyond 600 in the sails and the claim in an advertisement.\"\r\n\r\nMany thanks to 'Super Dorade' for sharing expertise on this and other subjects."}
