After Hurley Marine went out of business, the boat was built by South Coast Marine and then Ravensail. \r\nRavensail called their version the HURLEY 22R. \r\nLater still, some were built (under license)in Holland. (HURLEY 700)  \r\nHURLEY 22's differ from one another in many details including mast lengths, ballast material, internal finish and etc.. \r\nFin or bilge keels. Bilge keel version draws 2.5'. \r\nEarlier, non-bilge keel models, had a different shaped rudder on skeg.  \r\nBallast and disp. numbers that seem to be shared across most of the manufacturers literature seem to be unrealistic though they are quoted here.\r\n(Designer has stated bal/disp ratio was to be 40%.)"}
