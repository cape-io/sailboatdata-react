It is said the concept is based on the designers dissatisfaction with a trend towards complexity and fragility in many high performance 'off the beach' catamarans at the time. \r\nIn 1985, this evolved into the faster and wider 18ft dual-trapeze \"Spitfire\" model, still being built, and upon which the K1 is based. (The 'Regatta' version features a 'flat top mainsail, and gennaker for offwind sailing). \r\nRecognized as an official ISAF racing class in 2005."}
