The first TICON 30's were produced in Oakville Ontario, Canada. In 1983, an agreement was reached with Kelt Marine to manufacture the boat at Kelt's plant in Aurora, Ontario. It has been said that the quality of the T-30's improved following the move to Kelt Marine. For the most part, The Canadian T-30's were produced on a per-order basis. Many were semi-custom boats with special colors and small optional interior modifications. An estimated (35) T-30's were produced during the tenure of Ticon Yachts."}
