The 'hot molded' construction method had been developed by the builder for the WWII Swordfish torpedo plane. George O'Day was, at the time, the US agent for Fairey Marine, and some were said to have been imported to the US. (We have yet to see on in the US)\r\nToday the ATALANTA is regarded, as a rare classic with a large percentage of the original boats still sailing."}
