In 1974, C&C Yachts sold off the molds for this boat to a company called Enterprise Yachts. But they were soon passed on first, to Lindsay Plastics, and then to Capital Yachts, the company that built most NEWPORT 41's until the early 1990's. \r\nAt some point, a MkII model was introduced that featured a redesigned rudder and coachroof. (The photo above is of a MKII version.) \r\nDetermining specific dates between one version and another has proved to be difficult. There was also a model called a MIIIA. The dates listed here should be considered less than reliable."}
