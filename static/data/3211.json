(The rig was re-designed by Charles A. Nicholson in 1934.\r\nThe Victory Class has consisted of some 40 boats based in and around Portsmouth Harbor (UK), where the class still maintains an active racing schedule. There has been a VICTORY Class participation in the annual Cowes Week regatta since 1934. In 2006 the class made arrangements to have new boats built of fiberglass."}
