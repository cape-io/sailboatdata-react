First 10 were of wood.\r\nThe FG version (1963-) is a product from and mostly seen in Australia though a few molded plywood versions were first turned out there also.   \r\nInterior layouts vary significantly but the hull remained largely the same.\r\nMany were purchased as bare hulls or kits for owner completion.\r\nIt is thought that at least 400 were built until 1984."}
