The boat was originally called the Frolic 23 and went into production, along with a S&S Classic 31 and S&S Classic 37 in a boatyard in Burlington, Ontario. The original Frolic 23 sold for about $2000 new and many were built and delivered around Southern Ontario, although the company only lasted for about three years.\"\r\nThanks also to Jack Gutter and 'laxingirl' for providing additional information."}
