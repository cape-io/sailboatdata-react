Dimensions and description shown here are for the earlier version, a folkboat variant, with transom hung rudder, built of wood, and similar to what later came to be known as the FRISCO FLYER (of which there were a number of versions). See FRISCO FLYER for what that boat looks like.\r\nAnother OFFSHORE 26, built of FG and introduced in 1969 appears to be a different design, possibly based on the NEWELL CADET, (also sold by Cheoy Lee as the OFFSHORE 27.)   \r\nNeither boat, under this name, appear to have been built in great numbers."}
